Lesson 1: Modules and Require

In Node.js, modules are a fundamental part that allow you to organize your code and reuse funcionality in different parts of your application. Learning to work with modules is essential for effective development in Node.js

1.1 Understanding Modules in Node.js

Node.js uses a module system to organize code into different files and folders. Each Javascript file in Node.js is considered a module by default. Modules are used to encapsulate and export functions, variables, and objects for use in other files.

1.2 Import and Export Modules

To import functions or vairables from a module into another file. the 'require' keyword is used. Here is an example of how to import a function from another file:

// Watch your Excercises 1 and 2 that are on Introduction.

Exercise 1: Basic Modules

Create two JavaScript files, one called greeting.js and one called goodbye.js. In the greeting.js file, define a function that prints a greeting. Then, import this function into the goodbye.js file and use it to print a goodbye.
